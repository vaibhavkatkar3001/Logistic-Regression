##  **1 . Bank Full project**
### _Problem statement_

Whether the client has subscribed a term deposit or not. Binomial ("yes" or "no")
### _Method_
I used `LOGISTIC REGRESSION` to predict Whether the client has subscribed a term deposit or not.

### This code imports `LOGISTIC REGRESSION`

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline 
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score,confusion_matrix,roc_curve, auc
```

### _Business impact_

So I created a model using `LOGISTIC REGRESSION` which can predict Whether the client has subscribed a term deposit or not. And the Accuracy of this Model is 88.34 %. Which means model has well fitted.
